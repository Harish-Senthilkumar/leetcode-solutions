## Problem-Solving Strategy

### My Approach
1. **Understand** - Read the problem carefully, identify inputs/outputs and constraints
2. **Examples** - Work through examples to understand edge cases
3. **Approach** - Choose the right data structure and algorithm pattern
4. **Optimize** - Consider time and space complexity improvements
5. **Code** - Implement clean, readable solution
6. **Test** - Verify with test cases including edge cases

### Common Patterns
- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Binary Search
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Dynamic Programming
- Backtracking
- Greedy Algorithms
